 * PING - plume-in-grid - concentration file for coarse domain.  in GRDDED3 format.

 * PDM - Plume Dynamics file - PING in coarse domain?)

 * MET - Meteorology - relates to MCIP

 * m3conc - CCTM Concentration file

 * gas phase vs aerosol.  

 * aquesous phase (for rain?)

 * GRIDDESC is an ascii file describing the GRID (dimension).   It is for the horizontal layer only.  eg, think as base of a tall rectangle.  Is this usually a square?

 * MET_CRO_3D is for specifying the vertical layer structure.  Think of this as how high each "cell" of the modeling is.  This isn't usually same size as base, so it forms a tall slender rectangle rather than a cube in the 3D modeling program?

 * RUNLEN - number of hours of boundary condition to extract from CCTM CONF file.

 * Julian date.  normal date format used in US

 * Simulation date - (CMAQ date) YYYYddd with ddd as number of days since Jan 1.

 * Eulerian - linear model.  use a rectangle as space covered by array of number ?
