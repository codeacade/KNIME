Django framework for using REST with python
-------------------------------------------

Django use Model-View-Controller approach.
rely on Object-Relational Mapper.

* see also bofhbot project


Flask RESTful 
-------------

Django is bulky, the kitchenn sink and then some.  
Good for large web site, and when its pre-defined structure is desired..

Flask is more "unopionated", start out small, then add component as needed.
If need something small, then Flask is better.

Jinja template engine is to embed %if-then-else% to add code to html.
