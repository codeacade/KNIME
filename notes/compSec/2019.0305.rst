Operationally, ie routinely,


Routing
Autonomous system
Relatively small.
Tier1  provider.
Really small.
Get together 3 times a hear, drink beer and listen to talk.

So, the human overlay on top is doing the good job to make routing work, even when BGP is a trust based AS that is bound to have a disaster (since actor are not trust worthy all the time).

Run sppofing on edge-AS.


TCP attack tool:
Airpwn
Quantum

RST injection - send reset packet.
About 10% of all connection in inet is closed with RESET, not FIN.

CHINAâ€¦
Great firewall look at all unencrypted traffic.
They will inject RST to anything they don't like it.


Guessing initial TCP seq number
(random 32-bit in good protocol, so harder to guest).

Old tcp protocol, seq number is 1 more than the last seq.

Check if victim will reply to RST packet.

If attacker can see tcp traffic, it is screwed.  Can send RST, or spoof the traffic.

Joker on wifi.
Dnssec.
China.

Encrypt traffic with TLS
Does not help from getting RST by attacker.

Https server.

If predict seq number, can do blind spoof.

Ddos
10 to 100,000 machines as attack.

Record for DDOS
150 Gbps
Big enough that it disrupted akamai.

Minecraft server.
