Free plan includes:
* 50 GB tileset storage
*  5 GB dataset storage

Used so far as of 2019.0303
(25 sites, with limited source and capacity tiles 
in preview version of smelly)

Tilesets: 7.7 GB
(maybe old tiles not overwritten?)
else, it expanded by 3.5x and we may run out of space.


Datasets: 5 MB

csv-25sites had 750 tiles, totalling 1.8 GB.

all combination = 11700 tiles * 2.4MB = 28080 MB
ie 28 GB.
