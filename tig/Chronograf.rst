Chronograf
==========


Some place touted

InfluxDB 1.3 onward dropped interactive data explorer.
Touted the use of Chronograf for this purpose.

But my experience with it to just browse what data is in the InfluxDB has been next to useless.

Very few things can be done by browsing and clicking.
One has to know what databases, "tables" (measurements) are there, 
Essentially has to write query by hand.
it has a few template to fill.
but still had to learn what was doing.
Easier/better to do it at the influx cli!!


No need to install this POS next time around.
There are some data viz stuff.  but would be usingr Grafana.
